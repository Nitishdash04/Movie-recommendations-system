### **Movie Recommendation System Project**

**Objective:**
The goal of this project is to build a movie recommendation system that suggests movies to users based on their preferences. We'll use Python and Pandas to work with a dataset of movies and ratings, and explore different recommendation algorithms.

**Project Components:**

1. **Data Collection:**
   - Use a popular dataset like the [MovieLens dataset](https://grouplens.org/datasets/movielens/) for movie ratings.
   - The dataset consists of information about movies (title, genre, etc.) and user ratings.
   - Load the dataset using Pandas and perform basic cleaning (handling missing data, formatting, etc.).

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):**
   - Understand the dataset by analyzing user behaviors and movie features.
   - Use Pandas to group data, calculate averages, and generate insights like:
     - The most popular movies.
     - The highest-rated movies.
     - Trends in user ratings.

3. **Types of Recommendation Systems:**
   - **Content-Based Filtering:**
     - Recommend movies similar to those the user has liked based on movie metadata (e.g., genre, actors, director).
     - Use Pandas to create a similarity matrix based on movie features.
   - **Collaborative Filtering:**
     - Recommend movies by finding users with similar tastes (user-user or item-item similarity).
     - Use Pandas and libraries like `Surprise` or `SciPy` to implement this.
   - **Hybrid Method:**
     - Combine content-based and collaborative filtering for better recommendations.

4. **Model Building:**
   - **Content-Based Recommendation System:**
     - Use movie features (e.g., genres, tags) to recommend similar movies.
     - Use Pandas to create feature vectors for each movie and compute similarity using cosine similarity.
   - **Collaborative Filtering:**
     - Based on user-movie ratings, create a user-item interaction matrix.
     - Compute user-user or item-item similarity using matrix factorization or neighborhood-based approaches.

5. **Evaluation:**
   - Evaluate the recommendation systemâ€™s performance using metrics such as:
     - Precision
     - Recall
     - F1-Score
     - Mean Squared Error (MSE) for collaborative filtering

6. **User Interface (Optional):**
   - Create a basic user interface using `streamlit` or `flask` to let users input their preferences and get movie recommendations in real-time.

7. **Bonus:**
   - Add a functionality that allows users to search for a movie and get recommendations based on that search.
   - Implement a popularity-based recommendation system for new users (cold-start problem).
